Find the Princess aka Catch the Cat

# main-script.py
I discovered this logic puzzle called Find the Princess or Catch the Cat, so I made this little python script that is supposed to simulate it  and show the difference between optimal and non-optimal solution. Also it shows how much harder the cat/princess is if it knows your next move.

What I think is most interesting, is that even if the Cat knows your next move, there is a particular strategy that allows you to always win regardless.

For a game board with 5 spaces: 2 -> 3 -> 4 then 4 -> -3 -> 2 and repeat

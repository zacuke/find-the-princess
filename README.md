Find the Princess aka Catch the Cat

# main-script.py
I discovered this logic puzzle called Find the Princess or Catch the Cat, so I made this little python script that is supposed to simulate it  and show the difference between optimal and non-optimal solution. Also it shows how much harder the cat/princess is if it knows your next move.
